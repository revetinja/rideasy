Ridesharing web service

A user friendly web application that connects people for ridesharing!

## Features

1. **users will upload text annotations, related to specific geographical locations,through their user account:**
Users can share a trip they are planning to make in the future and specify the departure time details, the number of spots they have in their car, and a message for interested riders.

2. **users will be able to visually browse the other user’s annotations through the map browser interface:**
Through the search page, users can visually search for upcoming trips shared by other users and request for a ride.

3. **users will be able to search and sort through annotations by date and/or location(by submitting a postcode, location name, etc.):** 
Users filter their search by entering the origin and destination locations in an arbitrary form (e.g. place name, zip code, address etc.) and specify the departure date to further narrow the search.

4. **users with administrator access will be able to view and delete other user’s annotations and manipulate existing registered user accounts:**
Website administrators can manage user trips and user accounts. Furthermore, drivers who share a trip can approve or reject ride requests from other users.

Additional features include the following:

1. **find an appropriate web based API/dataset of geo-related data that can be overlaid with user annotations, in order to provide meaningful insight to the chosen information domain. For example overlay car theft data with parking availability data.**
2. **Users will be able to click on any point in the map to indicate their targetlocation, allowing them to search for the nearest annotated locations.**
3. **users will submit comments about previously submitted annotations.**
4. **users will be able to view submitted comments related to specific map annotations.**
5. **users will upload their annotations/comments as XML files. The system will extract the data elements from the file and insert them into the database.**
